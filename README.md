# Seeder
Generate JSON models for your objects

## Why?

HTML5 `WebWorker`s are cool and we wanted to process large data sets with them.

## Running locally

From the repository root, start a webserver. Python's `SimpleHTTPServer` is worth considering.

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Visit the server location and play around.
